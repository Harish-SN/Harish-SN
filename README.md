# Hi, I'm Harish 👋

Cloud / DevOps ☁️  
GitHub says I:
- Use **multiple programming languages**
- Write more configs than actual code
- Trust automation more than sleep
- Commit mostly when something breaks

---

### 🧠 Repo vibes
- Side projects that got serious
- Serious projects that started as side projects
- YAML files with personality
- Docker things running “temporarily”

---

### 🧭 Rules I follow
- If it’s manual → automate it
- If it’s slow → cache it
- If it works → don’t touch it

---
